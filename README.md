# convert-keybindings-jetbrains-to-vscode
Convert keybindings from Jetbrains products (PyCharm, Webstorm, etc.) to VSCode.

The JSON value "args" is specific to VSCode.

# Limitations

# Command Translation Dictionary Incomplete

The list of translatable commands between Jetbrains and VScode is (1) not complete, and (2) not fully tested, though I will be fixing any problems I encounter along the way.

Regarding the incomplete list of commands, I have finished adding the commands that I personally use. I will probably not add (many) more.

Input patches or simple user comments for more valid command translations between the IDEs is welcome. I will add more to the project when I receive them.

# Only Jetbrains to VSCode currently

At this time, the program only converts from Jetbrains to VSCode format.

Though it would not be very difficult to reverse the process.
